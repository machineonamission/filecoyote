# FileCoyote

extremely WIP Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) based file/media manager, designed to replace Hydrus

no disrespect to hydrus at all, the project is amazing, but it just didnt quite fit all of my needs. so here we are

EAV:

it's very similar to hydrus's tags

- Entity: the file/media
- Attribute: the tag type (eg: 'rating', 'character', 'artist', 'page', etc)
- Value: the tag value (eg: 'safe', 'john doe', 3, etc)

for those coming from hydrus, essentially filecoyote works the same except all tags must be namespaced.

i mean you can just make new tag categories with no value but that's not really how the system is designed
